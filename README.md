# Sequential Set Instruction

A set-based esoteric programming language made with Nim

## How to use

### Run SSS code

1. Clone this repo
2. Compile `desktopEnter.nim` with this command `nim c -d:release -o:whateverName.exe desktopEnter.nim` (you need to have Nim installed in your path)
3. Run the exe with path to the file you want to execute (for example `sss.exe C:\Documents\sss\twosums.sss`)

### Compile to other targets

I couldn't compile to Javascript, not sure why. But the main entry point is at `main.nim > runSss()` if you want to check it out.

## Syntax

It's all in the [wiki](https://github.com/CIOSAI/SequentialSetInstruction/wiki)
